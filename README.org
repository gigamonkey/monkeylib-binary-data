* binary-io

This library should be a drop in replacement for monkeylib-binary-data
described in Peter Seibel's excellent book: you should start [[http://gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-parsing-binary-files.html][here]].

It also contains the following optionals enhancements:
** definition/access of octet size of objects
   When defining a new binary-type, in addition to =:reader= and
   =:writer= definition, you can set a =:size= to calculate the octet
   size of this new type. You can then access this size with
   =type-size=

   Here is an example from =common-datatypes.lisp= (that comes with
   =binary-io= ;-)
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;;; Unsigned integers
(define-binary-type unsigned-integer (bits)
  (:reader (fd)
	   (assert (equal (stream-element-type fd) '(unsigned-byte 8)))
	   (let ((byte-indexes (byte-indexes bits *endianness*))
		 (value 0))
	     (dolist (i byte-indexes value)
	       (setf (ldb (byte 8 i) value) (read-byte fd)))))
  (:writer (fd value)
	   (assert (equal (stream-element-type fd) '(unsigned-byte 8)))
	   (let ((byte-indexes (byte-indexes bits *endianness*)))
	     (dolist (i byte-indexes)
	       (write-byte (ldb (byte 8 i) value) fd))))
  (:size () (ceiling bits 8)))

(define-binary-type u2 () (unsigned-integer :bits 16))

(type-size 'u2) ;; -> 2
#+END_SRC

   There is also an =object-size= method for binary class:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(define-binary-class test-size ()
  ((a u2)
   (b u2)))

(object-size 'test-size) ;; -> 4
#+END_SRC
** optional initform for slots
   You can precise an optional initform for a slot as a third value in
   the slot spec of a binary class definition:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(define-binary-class foo-header ()
  ((tag (8bit-string :length 4 :terminator #\Nul) "FOO")
   (counter u2 0)))
#+END_SRC
